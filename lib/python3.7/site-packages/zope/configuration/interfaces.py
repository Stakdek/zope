        A dotted name is constructed by concatenating a dotted module

        example, the object named "spam" in the foo.bar module has a
        dotted name of foo.bar.spam.  If the current package is a
        prefix of a dotted name, then the package name can be relaced
        with a leading dot, So, for example, if the configuration file
        is in the foo package, then the dotted name foo.bar.spam can
        be shortened to .bar.spam.

        If the current package is multiple levels deep, multiple
        leading dots can be used to refer to higher-level modules.
        For example, if the current package is x.y.z, the dotted
