<title>Extension Class</title>
<para>

A lightweight mechanism has been developed for making Python
    extension types more class-like.  Classes can be developed in an
    extension language, such as C or C++, and these classes can be
    treated like other python classes:</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>
They can be sub-classed in python,</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
They provide access to method documentation strings, and</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
They can be used to directly create new instances.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>

Extension classes provide additional extensions to class and
    instance semantics, including:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
A protocol for accessing subobjects "in the context of" their
      containers.  This is used to implement custom method types
      and <ulink url="Acquisition.html">environmental acquisition</ulink>.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
A protocol for overriding method call semantics.  This is used
      to implement "synchonized" classes and could be used to
      implement argument type checking.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
A protocol for class initialization that supports execution of a
      special <literal>__class_init__</literal>method after a class has been
      initialized.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>

Extension classes illustrate how the Python class mechanism can be
    extended and may provide a basis for improved or specialized class
    models.</para>
