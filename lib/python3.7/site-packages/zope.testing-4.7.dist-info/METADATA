This package provides a number of testing frameworks.

cleanup
  Provides a mixin class for cleaning up after tests that
  make global changes.

formparser
  An HTML parser that extracts form information.

  **Python 2 only**

  This is intended to support functional tests that need to extract
  information from HTML forms returned by the publisher.

  See formparser.txt.

loggingsupport
  Support for testing logging code

  If you want to test that your code generates proper log output, you
  can create and install a handler that collects output.

loghandler
  Logging handler for tests that check logging output.

module
  Lets a doctest pretend to be a Python module.

  See module.txt.

renormalizing
  Regular expression pattern normalizing output checker.
  Useful for doctests.

server
  Provides a simple HTTP server compatible with the zope.app.testing
  functional testing API.  Lets you interactively play with the system
  under test.  Helpful in debugging functional doctest failures.

  **Python 2 only**

setupstack
  A simple framework for automating doctest set-up and tear-down.
  See setupstack.txt.

wait
  A small utility for dealing with timing non-determinism
  See wait.txt.

doctestcase
  Support for defining doctests as methods of ``unittest.TestCase``
  classes so that they can be more easily found by test runners, like
  nose, that ignore test suites.

Getting started developing zope.testing
=======================================

zope.testing uses buildout.  To start, run ``python bootstrap.py``.  It will
create a number of directories and the ``bin/buildout`` script.  Next, run
``bin/buildout``.  It will create a test script for you.  Now, run ``bin/test``
to run the zope.testing test suite.


Parsing HTML Forms
==================

Sometimes in functional tests, information from a generated form must
be extracted in order to re-submit it as part of a subsequent request.
The `zope.testing.formparser` module can be used for this purpose.

NOTE
   formparser doesn't support Python 3.

The scanner is implemented using the `FormParser` class.  The
constructor arguments are the page data containing the form and
(optionally) the URL from which the page was retrieved:

  >>> import zope.testing.formparser

  >>> page_text = '''\
  ... <html><body>
  ...   <form name="form1" action="/cgi-bin/foobar.py" method="POST">
  ...     <input type="hidden" name="f1" value="today" />
  ...     <input type="submit" name="do-it-now" value="Go for it!" />
  ...     <input type="IMAGE" name="not-really" value="Don't."
  ...            src="dont.png" />
  ...     <select name="pick-two" size="3" multiple>
  ...       <option value="one" selected>First</option>
  ...       <option value="two" label="Second">Another</option>
  ...       <optgroup>
  ...         <option value="three">Third</option>
  ...         <option selected="selected">Fourth</option>
  ...       </optgroup>
  ...     </select>
  ...   </form>
  ...
  ...   Just for fun, a second form, after specifying a base:
  ...   <base href="http://www.example.com/base/" />
  ...   <form action = 'sproing/sprung.html' enctype="multipart/form">
  ...     <textarea name="sometext" rows="5">Some text.</textarea>
  ...     <input type="Image" name="action" value="Do something."
  ...            src="else.png" />
  ...     <input type="text" value="" name="multi" size="2" />
  ...     <input type="text" value="" name="multi" size="3" />
  ...   </form>
  ... </body></html>
  ... '''

  >>> parser = zope.testing.formparser.FormParser(page_text)
  >>> forms = parser.parse()

  >>> len(forms)
  2
  >>> forms.form1 is forms[0]
  True
  >>> forms.form1 is forms[1]
  False

More often, the `parse()` convenience function is all that's needed:

  >>> forms = zope.testing.formparser.parse(
  ...     page_text, "http://cgi.example.com/somewhere/form.html")

  >>> len(forms)
  2
  >>> forms.form1 is forms[0]
  True
  >>> forms.form1 is forms[1]
  False

Once we have the form we're interested in, we can check form
attributes and individual field values:

  >>> form = forms.form1
  >>> form.enctype
  'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
  >>> form.method
  'post'

  >>> keys = form.keys()
  >>> keys.sort()
  >>> keys
  ['do-it-now', 'f1', 'not-really', 'pick-two']

  >>> not_really = form["not-really"]
  >>> not_really.type
  'image'
  >>> not_really.value
  "Don't."
  >>> not_really.readonly
  False
  >>> not_really.disabled
  False

Note that relative URLs are converted to absolute URLs based on the
``<base>`` element (if present) or using the base passed in to the
constructor.

  >>> form.action
  'http://cgi.example.com/cgi-bin/foobar.py'
  >>> not_really.src
  'http://cgi.example.com/somewhere/dont.png'

  >>> forms[1].action
  'http://www.example.com/base/sproing/sprung.html'
  >>> forms[1]["action"].src
  'http://www.example.com/base/else.png'

Fields which are repeated are reported as lists of objects that
represent each instance of the field::

  >>> field = forms[1]["multi"]
  >>> isinstance(field, list)
  True
  >>> [o.value for o in field]
  ['', '']
  >>> [o.size for o in field]
  [2, 3]

The ``<textarea>`` element provides some additional attributes:

  >>> ta = forms[1]["sometext"]
  >>> print ta.rows
  5
  >>> print ta.cols
  None
  >>> ta.value
  'Some text.'

The ``<select>`` element provides access to the options as well:

  >>> select = form["pick-two"]
  >>> select.multiple
  True
  >>> select.size
  3
  >>> select.type
  'select'
  >>> select.value
  ['one', 'Fourth']

  >>> options = select.options
  >>> len(options)
  4
  >>> [opt.label for opt in options]
  ['First', 'Second', 'Third', 'Fourth']
  >>> [opt.value for opt in options]
  ['one', 'two', 'three', 'Fourth']


Support for testing logging code
================================

If you want to test that your code generates proper log output, you
can create and install a handler that collects output:

  >>> from zope.testing.loggingsupport import InstalledHandler
  >>> handler = InstalledHandler('foo.bar')

The handler is installed into loggers for all of the names passed. In
addition, the logger level is set to 1, which means, log
everything. If you want to log less than everything, you can provide a
level keyword argument.  The level setting effects only the named
loggers.

  >>> import logging
  >>> handler_with_levels = InstalledHandler('baz', level=logging.WARNING)

Then, any log output is collected in the handler:

  >>> logging.getLogger('foo.bar').exception('eek')
  >>> logging.getLogger('foo.bar').info('blah blah')

  >>> for record in handler.records:
  ...     print_(record.name, record.levelname)
  ...     print_(' ', record.getMessage())
  foo.bar ERROR
    eek
  foo.bar INFO
    blah blah

A similar effect can be gotten by just printing the handler:

  >>> print_(handler)
  foo.bar ERROR
    eek
  foo.bar INFO
    blah blah

After checking the log output, you need to uninstall the handler:

  >>> handler.uninstall()
  >>> handler_with_levels.uninstall()

At which point, the handler won't get any more log output.
Let's clear the handler:

  >>> handler.clear()
  >>> handler.records
  []

And then log something:

  >>> logging.getLogger('foo.bar').info('blah')

and, sure enough, we still have no output:

  >>> handler.records
  []


Regular expression pattern normalizing output checker
=====================================================

The pattern-normalizing output checker extends the default output checker with
an option to normalize expected and actual output.

You specify a sequence of patterns and replacements.  The replacements are
applied to the expected and actual outputs before calling the default outputs
checker.  Let's look at an example.  In this example, we have some times and
addresses:

    >>> want = '''\
    ... <object object at 0xb7f14438>
    ... completed in 1.234 seconds.
    ... <BLANKLINE>
    ... <object object at 0xb7f14440>
    ... completed in 123.234 seconds.
    ... <BLANKLINE>
    ... <object object at 0xb7f14448>
    ... completed in .234 seconds.
    ... <BLANKLINE>
    ... <object object at 0xb7f14450>
    ... completed in 1.234 seconds.
    ... <BLANKLINE>
    ... '''

    >>> got = '''\
    ... <object object at 0xb7f14458>
    ... completed in 1.235 seconds.
    ...
    ... <object object at 0xb7f14460>
    ... completed in 123.233 seconds.
    ...
    ... <object object at 0xb7f14468>
    ... completed in .231 seconds.
    ...
    ... <object object at 0xb7f14470>
    ... completed in 1.23 seconds.
    ...
    ... '''

We may wish to consider these two strings to match, even though they differ in
actual addresses and times.  The default output checker will consider them
different:

    >>> import doctest
    >>> doctest.OutputChecker().check_output(want, got, 0)
    False

We'll use the zope.testing.renormalizing.OutputChecker to normalize both the
wanted and gotten strings to ignore differences in times and
addresses:

    >>> import re
    >>> from zope.testing.renormalizing import OutputChecker
    >>> checker = OutputChecker([
    ...    (re.compile('[0-9]*[.][0-9]* seconds'), '<SOME NUMBER OF> seconds'),
    ...    (re.compile('at 0x[0-9a-f]+'), 'at <SOME ADDRESS>'),
    ...    ])

    >>> checker.check_output(want, got, 0)
    True

Usual OutputChecker options work as expected:

    >>> want_ellided = '''\
    ... <object object at 0xb7f14438>
    ... completed in 1.234 seconds.
    ... ...
    ... <object object at 0xb7f14450>
    ... completed in 1.234 seconds.
    ... <BLANKLINE>
    ... '''

    >>> checker.check_output(want_ellided, got, 0)
    False

    >>> checker.check_output(want_ellided, got, doctest.ELLIPSIS)
    True

When we get differencs, we output them with normalized text:

    >>> source = '''\
    ... >>> do_something()
    ... <object object at 0xb7f14438>
    ... completed in 1.234 seconds.
    ... ...
    ... <object object at 0xb7f14450>
    ... completed in 1.234 seconds.
    ... <BLANKLINE>
    ... '''

    >>> example = doctest.Example(source, want_ellided)

    >>> print_(checker.output_difference(example, got, 0))
    Expected:
        <object object at <SOME ADDRESS>>
        completed in <SOME NUMBER OF> seconds.
        ...
        <object object at <SOME ADDRESS>>
        completed in <SOME NUMBER OF> seconds.
        <BLANKLINE>
    Got:
        <object object at <SOME ADDRESS>>
        completed in <SOME NUMBER OF> seconds.
        <BLANKLINE>
        <object object at <SOME ADDRESS>>
        completed in <SOME NUMBER OF> seconds.
        <BLANKLINE>
        <object object at <SOME ADDRESS>>
        completed in <SOME NUMBER OF> seconds.
        <BLANKLINE>
        <object object at <SOME ADDRESS>>
        completed in <SOME NUMBER OF> seconds.
        <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>

    >>> print_(checker.output_difference(example, got,
    ...                                 doctest.REPORT_NDIFF))
    Differences (ndiff with -expected +actual):
        - <object object at <SOME ADDRESS>>
        - completed in <SOME NUMBER OF> seconds.
        - ...
          <object object at <SOME ADDRESS>>
          completed in <SOME NUMBER OF> seconds.
          <BLANKLINE>
        + <object object at <SOME ADDRESS>>
        + completed in <SOME NUMBER OF> seconds.
        + <BLANKLINE>
        + <object object at <SOME ADDRESS>>
        + completed in <SOME NUMBER OF> seconds.
        + <BLANKLINE>
        + <object object at <SOME ADDRESS>>
        + completed in <SOME NUMBER OF> seconds.
        + <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>

    If the wanted text is empty, however, we don't transform the actual output.
    This is usful when writing tests.  We leave the expected output empty, run
    the test, and use the actual output as expected, after reviewing it.

    >>> source = '''\
    ... >>> do_something()
    ... '''

    >>> example = doctest.Example(source, '\n')
    >>> print_(checker.output_difference(example, got, 0))
    Expected:
    <BLANKLINE>
    Got:
        <object object at 0xb7f14458>
        completed in 1.235 seconds.
        <BLANKLINE>
        <object object at 0xb7f14460>
        completed in 123.233 seconds.
        <BLANKLINE>
        <object object at 0xb7f14468>
        completed in .231 seconds.
        <BLANKLINE>
        <object object at 0xb7f14470>
        completed in 1.23 seconds.
        <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>

If regular expressions aren't expressive enough, you can use arbitrary Python
callables to transform the text.  For example, suppose you want to ignore
case during comparison:

    >>> checker = OutputChecker([
    ...    lambda s: s.lower(),
    ...    lambda s: s.replace('<blankline>', '<BLANKLINE>'),
    ...    ])

    >>> want = '''\
    ... Usage: thundermonkey [options] [url]
    ... <BLANKLINE>
    ... Options:
    ...     -h    display this help message
    ... '''

    >>> got = '''\
    ... usage: thundermonkey [options] [URL]
    ...
    ... options:
    ...     -h    Display this help message
    ... '''

    >>> checker.check_output(want, got, 0)
    True

Suppose we forgot that <BLANKLINE> must be in upper case:

    >>> checker = OutputChecker([
    ...    lambda s: s.lower(),
    ...    ])

    >>> checker.check_output(want, got, 0)
    False

The difference would show us that:

    >>> source = '''\
    ... >>> print_help_message()
    ... ''' + want
    >>> example = doctest.Example(source, want)
    >>> print_(checker.output_difference(example, got,
    ...                                 doctest.REPORT_NDIFF))
    Differences (ndiff with -expected +actual):
          usage: thundermonkey [options] [url]
        - <blankline>
        + <BLANKLINE>
          options:
              -h    display this help message
    <BLANKLINE>


It is possible to combine OutputChecker checkers for easy reuse:

    >>> address_and_time_checker = OutputChecker([
    ...    (re.compile('[0-9]*[.][0-9]* seconds'), '<SOME NUMBER OF> seconds'),
    ...    (re.compile('at 0x[0-9a-f]+'), 'at <SOME ADDRESS>'),
    ...    ])
    >>> lowercase_checker = OutputChecker([
    ...    lambda s: s.lower(),
    ...    ])
    >>> combined_checker = address_and_time_checker + lowercase_checker
    >>> len(combined_checker.transformers)
    3

Combining a checker with something else does not work:

    >>> lowercase_checker + 5 #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: ...

Using the 2to3 exception normalization:

    >>> from zope.testing.renormalizing import (
    ...     IGNORE_EXCEPTION_MODULE_IN_PYTHON2)
    >>> checker = OutputChecker()
    >>> want = """\
    ... Traceback (most recent call last):
    ... foo.bar.FooBarError: requires at least one argument."""
    >>> got = """\
    ... Traceback (most recent call last):
    ... FooBarError: requires at least one argument."""
    >>> result = checker.check_output(
    ...     want, got, IGNORE_EXCEPTION_MODULE_IN_PYTHON2)
    >>> import sys
    >>> if sys.version_info[0] < 3:
    ...     expected = True
    ... else:
    ...     expected = False
    >>> result == expected
    True

When reporting a failing test and running in Python 2, the normalizer tries
to be helpful by explaining how to test for exceptions in the traceback output.

    >>> want = """\
    ... Traceback (most recent call last):
    ... foo.bar.FooBarErrorXX: requires at least one argument.
    ... """
    >>> got = """\
    ... Traceback (most recent call last):
    ... FooBarError: requires at least one argument.
    ... """
    >>> checker.check_output(want, got, IGNORE_EXCEPTION_MODULE_IN_PYTHON2)
    False
    >>> from doctest import Example
    >>> example = Example('dummy', want)
    >>> result = checker.output_difference(
    ...     example, got, IGNORE_EXCEPTION_MODULE_IN_PYTHON2)
    >>> output = """\
    ... Expected:
    ...     Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...     foo.bar.FooBarErrorXX: requires at least one argument.
    ... Got:
    ...     Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...     FooBarError: requires at least one argument.
    ... """
    >>> hint = """\
    ...     ===============================================================
    ...     HINT:
    ...       The optionflag IGNORE_EXCEPTION_MODULE_IN_PYTHON2 is set.
    ...       You seem to test traceback output.
    ...       If you are indeed, make sure to use the full dotted name of
    ...       the exception class like Python 3 displays,
    ...       even though you are running the tests in Python 2.
    ...       The exception message needs to be last line (and thus not
    ...       split over multiple lines).
    ...     ==============================================================="""
    >>> if sys.version_info[0] < 3:
    ...     expected = output + hint
    ... else:
    ...     expected = output
    >>> result == expected
    True


Stack-based test setUp and tearDown
===================================

Writing doctest setUp and tearDown functions can be a bit tedious,
especially when setUp/tearDown functions are combined.

the zope.testing.setupstack module provides a small framework for
automating test tear down.  It provides a generic setUp function that
sets up a stack. Normal test setUp functions call this function to set
up the stack and then use the register function to register tear-down
functions.

To see how this works we'll create a faux test:

    >>> class Test:
    ...     def __init__(self):
    ...         self.globs = {}
    >>> test = Test()

We'll register some tearDown functions that just print something:

    >>> import sys
    >>> import zope.testing.setupstack
    >>> zope.testing.setupstack.register(
    ...     test, lambda : sys.stdout.write('td 1\n'))
    >>> zope.testing.setupstack.register(
    ...     test, lambda : sys.stdout.write('td 2\n'))

Now, when we call the tearDown function:

    >>> zope.testing.setupstack.tearDown(test)
    td 2
    td 1

The registered tearDown functions are run. Note that they are run in
the reverse order that they were registered.


Extra positional arguments can be passed to register:

    >>> zope.testing.setupstack.register(
    ...    test, lambda x, y, z: sys.stdout.write('%s %s %s\n' % (x, y, z)),
    ...    1, 2, z=9)
    >>> zope.testing.setupstack.tearDown(test)
    1 2 9


Temporary Test Directory
------------------------

Often, tests create files as they demonstrate functionality.  They
need to arrange for the removeal of these files when the test is
cleaned up.

The setUpDirectory function automates this.  We'll get the current
directory first:

    >>> import os
    >>> here = os.getcwd()

We'll also create a new test:

    >>> test = Test()

Now we'll call the setUpDirectory function:

    >>> zope.testing.setupstack.setUpDirectory(test)

We don't have to call zope.testing.setupstack.setUp, because
setUpDirectory calls it for us.

Now the current working directory has changed:

    >>> here == os.getcwd()
    False
    >>> setupstack_cwd = os.getcwd()

We can create files to out heart's content:

    >>> with open('Data.fs', 'w') as f:
    ...     foo = f.write('xxx')
    >>> os.path.exists(os.path.join(setupstack_cwd, 'Data.fs'))
    True

We'll make the file read-only. This can cause problems on Windows, but
setupstack takes care of that by making files writable before trying
to remove them.

    >>> import stat
    >>> os.chmod('Data.fs', stat.S_IREAD)

On Unix systems, broken symlinks can cause problems because the chmod
attempt by the teardown hook will fail; let's set up a broken symlink as
well, and verify the teardown doesn't break because of that:

    >>> if sys.platform != 'win32':
    ...     os.symlink('NotThere', 'BrokenLink')

When tearDown is called:

    >>> zope.testing.setupstack.tearDown(test)

We'll be back where we started:

    >>> here == os.getcwd()
    True

and the files we created will be gone (along with the temporary
directory that was created:

    >>> os.path.exists(os.path.join(setupstack_cwd, 'Data.fs'))
    False

Context-manager support
-----------------------

You can leverage context managers using the ``contextmanager`` method.
The result of calling the content manager's __enter__ method will be
returned. The context-manager's __exit__ method will be called as part
of test tear down:

    >>> class Manager(object):
    ...     def __init__(self, *args, **kw):
    ...         if kw:
    ...             args += (kw, )
    ...         self.args = args
    ...     def __enter__(self):
    ...         print_('enter', *self.args)
    ...         return 42
    ...     def __exit__(self, *args):
    ...         print_('exit', args, *self.args)

    >>> manager = Manager()
    >>> test = Test()

    >>> zope.testing.setupstack.context_manager(test, manager)
    enter
    42

    >>> zope.testing.setupstack.tearDown(test)
    exit (None, None, None)

.. faux mock

    >>> old_mock = sys.modules.get('mock')
    >>> class FauxMock:
    ...     @classmethod
    ...     def patch(self, *args, **kw):
    ...         return Manager(*args, **kw)

    >>> sys.modules['mock'] = FauxMock

By far the most commonly called context manager is ``mock.patch``, so
there's a convenience function to make that simpler:

    >>> zope.testing.setupstack.mock(test, 'time.time', return_value=42)
    enter time.time {'return_value': 42}
    42

    >>> zope.testing.setupstack.tearDown(test)
    exit (None, None, None) time.time {'return_value': 42}

globs
-----

Doctests have ``globs`` attributes used to hold test globals.
``setupstack`` was originally designed to work with doctests, but can
now work with either doctests, or other test objects, as long as the
test objects have either a ``globs`` attribute or a ``__dict__``
attribute.  The ``zope.testing.setupstack.globs`` function is used to
get the globals for a test object:

    >>> zope.testing.setupstack.globs(test) is test.globs
    True

Here, because the test object had a ``globs`` attribute, it was
returned. Because we used the test object above, it has a setupstack:

    >>> '__zope.testing.setupstack' in test.globs
    True

If we remove the ``globs`` attribute, the object's instance dictionary
will be used:

    >>> del test.globs
    >>> zope.testing.setupstack.globs(test) is test.__dict__
    True
    >>> zope.testing.setupstack.context_manager(test, manager)
    enter
    42

    >>> '__zope.testing.setupstack' in test.__dict__
    True

The ``globs`` function is used internally, but can also be used by
setup code to support either doctests or other test objects.

TestCase
--------

A TestCase class is provided that:

- Makes it easier to call setupstack apis, and

- provides an inheritable tearDown method.

In addition to a tearDown method, the class provides methods:

``setupDirectory()``
    Creates a temporary directory, runs the test, and cleans it up.

``register(func)``
    Register a tear-down function.

``context_manager(manager)``
    Enters a context manager and exits it on tearDown.

``mock(*args, **kw)``
    Enters  ``mock.patch`` with the given arguments.

    This is syntactic sugur for::

        context_manager(mock.patch(*args, **kw))

Here's an example:

    >>> open('t', 'w').close()

    >>> class MyTests(zope.testing.setupstack.TestCase):
    ...
    ...     def setUp(self):
    ...         self.setUpDirectory()
    ...         self.context_manager(manager)
    ...         self.mock("time.time", return_value=42)
    ...
    ...         @self.register
    ...         def _():
    ...             print('done w test')
    ...
    ...     def test(self):
    ...         print(os.listdir('.'))

.. let's try it

    >>> import unittest
    >>> loader = unittest.TestLoader()
    >>> suite = loader.loadTestsFromTestCase(MyTests)
    >>> result = suite.run(unittest.TestResult())
    enter
    enter time.time {'return_value': 42}
    []
    done w test
    exit (None, None, None) time.time {'return_value': 42}
    exit (None, None, None)

.. cleanup

    >>> if old_mock:
    ...     sys.modules['mock'] = old_mock
    ... else:
    ...     del sys.modules['mock']
    >>> os.remove('t')



Wait until a condition holds (or until a time out)
==================================================

Often, in tests, you need to wait until some condition holds.  This
may be because you're testing interaction with an external system or
testing threaded (threads, processes, greenlet's, etc.) interactions.

You can add sleeps to your tests, but it's often hard to know how
long to sleep.

``zope.testing.wait`` provides a convenient way to wait until
some condition holds.  It will test a condition and, when true,
return.  It will sleep a short time between tests.

Here's a silly example, that illustrates it's use:

    >>> from zope.testing.wait import wait
    >>> wait(lambda : True)

Since the condition we passed is always True, it returned
immediately.  If the condition doesn't hold, then we'll get a timeout:

    >>> wait((lambda : False), timeout=.01)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TimeOutWaitingFor: <lambda>

``wait`` has some keyword options:

timeout
   How long, in seconds, to wait for the condition to hold

   Defaults to 9 seconds.

wait
   How long to wait between calls.

   Defaults to .01 seconds.

message
   A message (or other data) to pass to the timeout exception.

   This defaults to ``None``.  If this is false, then the callable's
   doc string or ``__name__`` is used.

``wait`` can be used as a decorator:

    >>> @wait
    ... def ok():
    ...     return True

    >>> @wait(timeout=.01)
    ... def no_way():
    ...     pass
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TimeOutWaitingFor: no_way

    >>> @wait(timeout=.01)
    ... def no_way():
    ...     "never true"
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TimeOutWaitingFor: never true

.. more tests

    >>> import time
    >>> now = time.time()
    >>> @wait(timeout=.01, message='dang')
    ... def no_way():
    ...     "never true"
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TimeOutWaitingFor: dang

    >>> .01 < (time.time() - now) < .03
    True


Customization
-------------

``wait`` is an instance of ``Wait``.  With ``Wait``,
you can create you're own custom ``wait`` utilities.  For
example, if you're testing something that uses getevent, you'd want to
use gevent's sleep function:

    >>> import zope.testing.wait
    >>> wait = zope.testing.wait.Wait(getsleep=lambda : gevent.sleep)

Wait takes a number of customization parameters:

exception
  Timeout exception class

getnow
  Function used to get a function for getting the current time.

  Default: lambda : time.time

getsleep
  Function used to get a sleep function.

  Default: lambda : time.sleep

timeout
  Default timeout

  Default: 9

wait
  Default time to wait between attempts

  Default: .01


.. more tests

    >>> def mysleep(t):
    ...     print_('mysleep', t)
    ...     time.sleep(t)

    >>> def mynow():
    ...     print_('mynow')
    ...     return time.time()

    >>> wait = zope.testing.wait.Wait(
    ...    getnow=(lambda : mynow), getsleep=(lambda : mysleep),
    ...    exception=ValueError, timeout=.1, wait=.02)

    >>> @wait
    ... def _(state=[]):
    ...     if len(state) > 1:
    ...        return True
    ...     state.append(0)
    mynow
    mysleep 0.02
    mynow
    mysleep 0.02

    >>> @wait(wait=.002)
    ... def _(state=[]):
    ...     if len(state) > 1:
    ...        return True
    ...     state.append(0)
    mynow
    mysleep 0.002
    mynow
    mysleep 0.002

    >>> @wait(timeout=0)
    ... def _(state=[]):
    ...     if len(state) > 1:
    ...        return True
    ...     state.append(0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: _

    >>> wait = zope.testing.wait.Wait(timeout=0)
    >>> @wait(timeout=0)
    ... def _(state=[]):
    ...     if len(state) > 1:
    ...        return True
    ...     state.append(0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TimeOutWaitingFor: _


Doctests in TestCase classes
============================

The original ``doctest`` unittest integration was based on
``unittest`` test suites, which have fallen out of favor. This module
provides a way to define doctests inside of unittest ``TestCase``
classes. It provides better integration with unittest test fixtures,
because doctests use setup provided by the containing test case
class. It provides access to unittest assertion methods.

You can define doctests in multiple ways:

- references to named files

- strings

- decorated functions with docstrings

- reference to named files decorating test-specific setup functions

- reference to named files decorating a test class

.. some setup

   >>> __name__ = 'tests'

Here are some examples::

    >>> from zope.testing import doctestcase
    >>> import doctest
    >>> import unittest

    >>> g = 'global'

    >>> class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):
    ...
    ...     def setUp(self):
    ...         self.a = 1
    ...         self.globs = dict(c=9)
    ...
    ...     test1 = doctestcase.file('test-1.txt', optionflags=doctest.ELLIPSIS)
    ...
    ...     test2 = doctestcase.docteststring('''
    ...       >>> self.a, g, c
    ...       (1, 'global', 9)
    ...     ''')
    ...
    ...     @doctestcase.doctestmethod(optionflags=doctest.ELLIPSIS)
    ...     def test3(self):
    ...         '''
    ...         >>> self.a, self.x, g, c
    ...         (1, 3, 'global', 9)
    ...         '''
    ...         self.x = 3
    ...
    ...     @doctestcase.doctestfile('test4.txt')
    ...     def test4(self):
    ...         self.x = 5

    >>> import sys

    >>> @doctestcase.doctestfiles('loggingsupport.txt', 'renormalizing.txt')
    ... class MoreTests(unittest.TestCase):
    ...
    ...    def setUp(self):
    ...        def print_(*args):
    ...            sys.stdout.write(' '.join(map(str, args))+'\n')
    ...        self.globs = dict(print_=print_)


.. We can run these tests with the ``unittest`` test runner.

    >>> loader = unittest.TestLoader()
    >>> sys.stdout.writeln = lambda s: sys.stdout.write(s+'\n')
    >>> suite = loader.loadTestsFromTestCase(MyTest)
    >>> result = suite.run(unittest.TextTestResult(sys.stdout, True, 3))
    test1 (tests.MyTest) ... ok
    test2 (tests.MyTest) ... ok
    test3 (tests.MyTest) ... ok
    test4 (tests.MyTest) ... ok

    >>> suite = loader.loadTestsFromTestCase(MoreTests)
    >>> result = suite.run(unittest.TextTestResult(sys.stdout, True, 3))
    test_loggingsupport (tests.MoreTests) ... ok
    test_renormalizing (tests.MoreTests) ... ok

    >>> for _, e in result.errors:
    ...     print(e); print

    Check meta data:

    >>> MyTest.test1.__name__
    'test_1'
    >>> import os, zope.testing
    >>> (MyTest.test1.filepath ==
    ...  os.path.join(os.path.dirname(zope.testing.__file__), 'test-1.txt'))
    True
    >>> MyTest.test1.filename
    'test-1.txt'

    >>> MyTest.test3.__name__
    'test3'
    >>> MyTest.test4.__name__
    'test4'

    >>> (MyTest.test4.filepath ==
    ...  os.path.join(os.path.dirname(zope.testing.__file__), 'test4.txt'))
    True
    >>> MyTest.test4.filename
    'test4.txt'

    >>> MoreTests.test_loggingsupport.__name__
    'test_loggingsupport'
    >>> MoreTests.test_loggingsupport.filename
    'loggingsupport.txt'
    >>> (MoreTests.test_loggingsupport.filepath ==
    ...  os.path.join(os.path.dirname(zope.testing.__file__),
    ...               'loggingsupport.txt'))
    True

In these examples, 4 constructors were used:

doctestfile (alias: file)
  doctestfile makes a file-based test case.

  This can be used as a decorator, in which case, the decorated
  function is called before the test is run, to provide test-specific
  setup.

doctestfiles (alias: files)
  doctestfiles makes file-based test cases and assigns them to the
  decorated class.

  Multiple files can be specified and the resulting doctests are added
  as members of the decorated class.

docteststring (alias string)
  docteststring constructs a doctest from a string.

doctestmethod (alias method)
  doctestmethod constructs a doctest from a method.

  The method's docstring provides the test. The method's body provides
  optional test-specific setup.

Note that short aliases are provided, which maye be useful in certain
import styles.

Tests have access to the following data:

- Tests created with the ``docteststring`` and ``doctestmethod``
  constructors have access to the module globals of the defining
  module.

- In tests created with the ``docteststring`` and ``doctestmethod``
  constructors, the test case instance is available as the ``self``
  variable.

- In tests created with the ``doctestfile`` and ``doctestfiles``
  constructor, the test case instance is available as the ``test``
  variable.

- If a test case defines a globs attribute, it must be a dictionary
  and it's contents are added to the test globals.

The constructors accept standard doctest ``optionflags`` and
``checker`` arguments.

Note that the doctest IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL option flag is
added to optionflags.

When using ``doctestfile`` and ``doctestfile``, ``filename`` and
``filepath`` attributes are available that contain the test file name
and full path.

``__name__`` attributes of class members
----------------------------------------

Class members have ``__name__`` attributes set as follows:

- When using ``doctestmethod`` or ``doctestfile`` with a setup
  function, ``__name__`` attribute is set to the name of the function.
  A ``test_`` prefix is added, if the name doesn't start with ``test``.

- When ``doctestfile`` is used without a setup function or when
  ``doctestfiles`` is used, ``__name__`` is set to the last part of the
  file path with the extension removed and non-word characters
  converted to underscores. For example, with a test path of
  ``'/foo/bar/test-it.rst'``, the ``__name__`` attribute is set to
  ``'test_it'``.  A ``test_`` prefix is added, if the name doesn't
  start with ``test``.

- when using ``docteststring``, a ``name`` option can be passed in to
  set ``__name__``.  A ``test_`` prefix is added, if the name doesn't
  start with ``test``.

The ``__name__`` attribute is important when using nose, because nose
discovers tests as class members using their ``__name__`` attributes,
whereas the unittest and py.test test runners use class dictionary keys.

.. Let's look at some failure cases:

    >>> class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):
    ...
    ...     test2 = doctestcase.string('''

Changes
=======

4.7 (2018-10-04)
----------------

- Added support for Python 3.7.


4.6.2 (2017-06-12)
------------------

- Remove dependencies on ``zope.interface`` and ``zope.exceptions``;
  they're not used here.

- Remove use of 2to3 for outdated versions of PyPy3, letting us build
  universal wheels.


4.6.1 (2017-01-04)
------------------

- Add support for Python 3.6.


4.6.0 (2016-10-20)
------------------

- Introduce option flag ``IGNORE_EXCEPTION_MODULE_IN_PYTHON2`` to normalize
  exception class names in traceback output. In Python 3 they are displayed as
  the full dotted name. In Python 2 they are displayed as "just" the class
  name.  When running doctests in Python 3, the option flag will not have any
  effect, however when running the same test in Python 2, the segments in the
  full dotted name leading up to the class name are stripped away from the
  "expected" string.

- Drop support for Python 2.6 and 3.2.

- Add support for Python 3.5.

- Cleaned up useless 2to3 conversion.

4.5.0 (2015-09-02)
------------------

- Added meta data for test case methods created with
  ``zope.testing.doctestcase``.

  - Reasonable values for ``__name__``, making sure that ``__name__``
    starts with ``test``.

  - For ``doctestfile`` methods, provide ``filename`` and ``filepath``
    attributes.

  The meta data us useful, for example, for selecting tests with the
  nose attribute mechanism.

- Added ``doctestcase.doctestfiles``

  - Define multiple doctest files at once.

  - Automatically assign test class members.  So rather than::

      class MYTests(unittest.TestCase):
          ...
          test_foo = doctestcase.doctestfile('foo.txt')

    You can use::

      @doctestcase.doctestfiles('foo.txt', 'bar.txt', ...)
      class MYTests(unittest.TestCase):
          ...

4.4.0 (2015-07-16)
------------------

- Added ``zope.testing.setupstack.mock`` as a convenience function for
  setting up mocks in tests.  (The Python ``mock`` package must be in
  the path for this to work. The excellent ``mock`` package isn't a
  dependency of ``zope.testing``.)

- Added the base class ``zope.testing.setupstack.TestCase`` to make it
  much easier to use ``zope.testing.setupstack`` in ``unittest`` test
  cases.


4.3.0 (2015-07-15)
------------------

- Added support for creating doctests as methods of
  ``unittest.TestCase`` classes so that they can found automatically
  by test runners, like *nose* that ignore test suites.

4.2.0 (2015-06-01)
------------------

- **Actually** remove long-deprecated ``zope.testing.doctest`` (announced as
  removed in 4.0.0) and ``zope.testing.doctestunit``.

- Add support for PyPy and PyPy3.

4.1.3 (2014-03-19)
------------------

- Add support for Python 3.4.

- Update ``boostrap.py`` to version 2.2.

4.1.2 (2013-02-19)
------------------

- Adjust Trove classifiers to reflect the currently supported Python
  versions. Officially drop Python 2.4 and 2.5. Add Python 3.3.

- LP: #1055720: Fix failing test on Python 3.3 due to changed exception
  messaging.

4.1.1 (2012-02-01)
------------------

- Fix: Windows test failure.

4.1.0 (2012-01-29)
------------------

- Add context-manager support to ``zope.testing.setupstack``

- Make ``zope.testing.setupstack`` usable with all tests, not just
  doctests and added ``zope.testing.setupstack.globs``, which makes it
  easier to write test setup code that workes with doctests and other
  kinds of tests.

- Add the ``wait`` module, which makes it easier to deal with
  non-deterministic timing issues.

- Rename ``zope.testing.renormalizing.RENormalizing`` to
  ``zope.testing.renormalizing.OutputChecker``. The old name is an
  alias.

- Update tests to run with Python 3.

- Label more clearly which features are supported by Python 3.

- Reorganize documentation.

4.0.0 (2011-11-09)
------------------

- Remove the deprecated ``zope.testing.doctest``.

  working directory.


3.10.2 (2010-11-30)
-------------------

- Fix test of broken symlink handling to not break on Windows.


3.10.1 (2010-11-29)
-------------------

- Update fix for LP #221151 to a spelling compatible with Python 2.4.

3.9.5 (2010-05-19)
------------------

- LP #579019: When layers are run in parallel, ensure that each ``tearDown``
  is called, including the first layer which is run in the main
  thread.

- Deprecate ``zope.testing.testrunner`` and ``zope.testing.exceptions``.
  They have been moved to a separate zope.testrunner module, and will be

------------------

- Remove import of ``zope.testing.doctest`` from ``zope.testing.renormalizer``.

- Suppress output to ``sys.stderr`` in ``testrunner-layers-ntd.txt``.

- Suppress ``zope.testing.doctest`` deprecation warning when running
  our own test suite.


3.9.2 (2010-03-15)
------------------

- Fix broken ``from zope.testing.doctest import *``

3.9.1 (2010-03-15)
------------------

- No changes; reupload to fix broken 3.9.0 release on PyPI.

3.9.0 (2010-03-12)
------------------

- Modify the testrunner to use the standard Python ``doctest`` module instead
  of the deprecated ``zope.testing.doctest``.

- Fix ``testrunner-leaks.txt`` to use the ``run_internal`` helper, so that
  ``sys.exit`` isn't triggered during the test run.

- Add support for conditionally using a subunit-based output
  formatter upon request if subunit and testtools are available. Patch
  contributed by Jonathan Lange.

3.8.7 (2010-01-26)
------------------

- Downgrade the ``zope.testing.doctest`` deprecation warning into a
  PendingDeprecationWarning.

3.8.6 (2009-12-23)
------------------

- Add ``MANIFEST.in`` and reupload to fix broken 3.8.5 release on PyPI.


3.8.5 (2009-12-23)
------------------

- Add back ``DocFileSuite``, ``DocTestSuite``, ``debug_src`` and ``debug``
  BBB imports back into ``zope.testing.doctestunit``; apparently many packages
  still import them from there!

- Deprecate ``zope.testing.doctest`` and ``zope.testing.doctestunit``
  in favor of the stdlib ``doctest`` module.


3.8.4 (2009-12-18)
------------------

- Fix missing imports and undefined variables reported by pyflakes,
  adding tests to exercise the blind spots.

- Cleaned up unused imports reported by pyflakes.

- Add two new options to generate randomly ordered list of tests and to
  select a specific order of tests.

- Allow combining RENormalizing checkers via ``+`` now:
  ``checker1 + checker2`` creates a checker with the transformations of both
  checkers.

- Fix tests under Python 2.7.

3.8.3 (2009-09-21)
------------------

- Fix test failures due to using ``split()`` on filenames when running from a
  directory with spaces in it.

- Fix testrunner behavior on Windows for ``-j2`` (or greater) combined with
  ``-v`` (or greater).

3.8.2 (2009-09-15)
------------------

- Remove hotshot profiler when using Python 2.6. That makes zope.testing
  compatible with Python 2.6


3.8.1 (2009-08-12)
------------------

- Avoid hardcoding ``sys.argv[0]`` as script;
  allow, for instance, Zope 2's `bin/instance test` (LP#407916).

- Produce a clear error message when a subprocess doesn't follow the
  ``zope.testing.testrunner`` protocol (LP#407916).

- Avoid unnecessarily squelching verbose output in a subprocess when there are
  not multiple subprocesses.

- Avoid unnecessarily batching subprocess output, which can stymie automated
  and human processes for identifying hung tests.

- Include incremental output when there are multiple subprocesses and a
  verbosity of ``-vv`` or greater is requested.  This again is not batched,
  supporting automated processes and humans looking for hung tests.


3.8.0 (2009-07-24)
------------------

- Allow testrunner to include descendants of ``unittest.TestCase`` in test
  modules, which no longer need to provide ``test_suite()``.


3.7.7 (2009-07-15)
------------------

- Clean up support for displaying tracebacks with supplements by turning it
  into an always-enabled feature and making the dependency on
  ``zope.exceptions`` explicit.

- Fix #251759: prevent the testrunner descending into directories that
  aren't Python packages.

- Code cleanups.


3.7.6 (2009-07-02)
------------------

- Add zope-testrunner ``console_scripts`` entry point. This exposes a
  ``zope-testrunner`` script with default installs allowing the testrunner
  to be run from the command line.

3.7.5 (2009-06-08)
------------------

- Fix bug when running subprocesses on Windows.

- The option ``REPORT_ONLY_FIRST_FAILURE`` (command line option "-1") is now
  respected even when a doctest declares its own ``REPORTING_FLAGS``, such as
  ``REPORT_NDIFF``.

- Fix bug that broke readline with pdb when using doctest
  (see http://bugs.python.org/issue5727).

- Make tests pass on Windows and Linux at the same time.


3.7.4 (2009-05-01)
------------------

- Filenames of doctest examples now contain the line number and not
  only the example number. So a stack trace in pdb tells the exact
  line number of the current example. This fixes
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/339813

- Colorization of doctest output correctly handles blank lines.


3.7.3 (2009-04-22)
------------------

- Improve handling of rogue threads:  always exit with status so even
  spinning daemon threads won't block the runner from exiting. This deprecated
  the ``--with-exit-status`` option.


3.7.2 (2009-04-13)
------------------

- Fix test failure on Python 2.4 due to slight difference in the way
  coverage is reported (__init__ files with only a single comment line are now
  not reported)

- Fix bug that caused the test runner to hang when running subprocesses (as a
  result Python 2.3 is no longer supported).

- Work around a bug in Python 2.6 (related to
  http://bugs.python.org/issue1303673) that causes the profile tests to fail.

- Add explanitory notes to ``buildout.cfg`` about how to run the tests with
  multiple versions of Python


3.7.1 (2008-10-17)
------------------

- The ``setupstack`` temporary directory support now properly handles
  read-only files by making them writable before removing them.


3.7.0 (2008-09-22)
------------------

- Add alterate setuptools / distutils commands for running all tests
  using our testrunner.  See 'zope.testing.testrunner.eggsupport:ftest'.

- Add a setuptools-compatible test loader which skips tests with layers:
  the testrunner used by ``setup.py test`` doesn't know about them, and those
  tests then fail.  See ``zope.testing.testrunner.eggsupport:SkipLayers``.

- Add support for Jython, when a garbage collector call is sent.

- Add support to bootstrap on Jython.

- Fix NameError in StartUpFailure.

- Open doctest files in universal mode, so that packages released on Windows
  can be tested on Linux, for example.


3.6.0 (2008-07-10)
------------------

- Add ``-j`` option to parallel tests run in subprocesses.

- RENormalizer accepts plain Python callables.

- Add ``--slow-test`` option.

- Add ``--no-progress`` and ``--auto-progress`` options.

- Complete refactoring of the test runner into multiple code files and a more
  modular (pipeline-like) architecture.

- Unify unit tests with the layer support by introducing a real unit test
  layer.

- Add a doctest for ``zope.testing.module``. There were several bugs
  that were fixed:

  * ``README.txt`` was a really bad default argument for the module
    name, as it is not a proper dotted name. The code would
    immediately fail as it would look for the ``txt`` module in the
    ``README`` package. The default is now ``__main__``.

  * The ``tearDown`` function did not clean up the ``__name__`` entry in the
    global dictionary.

- Fix a bug that caused a SubprocessError to be generated if a subprocess
  sent any output to stderr.

- Fix a bug that caused the unit tests to be skipped if run in a subprocess.


3.5.1 (2007-08-14)
------------------

- Invoke post-mortem debugging for layer-setup failures.

3.5.0 (2007-07-19)
------------------

- Ensure that the test runner works on Python 2.5.

- Add support for ``cProfile``.

- Add output colorizing (``-c`` option).

- Add ``--hide-secondary-failures`` and ``--show-secondary-failures`` options
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/115454).

- Fix some problems with Unicode in doctests.

- Fix "Error reading from subprocess" errors on Unix-like systems.

3.4 (2007-03-29)
----------------

- Add ``exit-with-status`` support (supports use with buildbot and
  ``zc.recipe.testing``)

- Add a small framework for automating set up and tear down of
  doctest tests. See ``setupstack.txt``.

- Allow ``testrunner-wo-source.txt`` and ``testrunner-errors.txt`` to run
  within a read-only source tree.

3.0 (2006-09-20)
----------------

- Update the doctest copy with text-file encoding support.

- Add logging-level support to the ``loggingsuppport`` module.

- At verbosity-level 1, dots are not output continuously, without any
  line breaks.

- Improve output when the inability to tear down a layer causes tests
  to be run in a subprocess.

- Make ``zope.exception`` required only if the ``zope_tracebacks`` extra is
  requested.

- Fix the test coverage. If a module, for example `interfaces`, was in an
  ignored directory/package, then if a module of the same name existed in a
  covered directory/package, then it was also ignored there, because the
  ignore cache stored the result by module name and not the filename of the
  module.

2.0 (2006-01-05)
----------------

- Release a separate project corresponding to the version of ``zope.testing``
  shipped as part of the Zope 3.2.0 release.
