This package contains exception exceptions and implementations which are so
general purpose that they don't belong in Zope application-specific packages.

Please see https://zopeexceptions.readthedocs.io/ for the documentation.


===========================
 zope.exceptions Changelog
===========================

4.3 (2018-10-04)
================

- Add support for Python 3.7.


4.2.0 (2017-09-12)
==================

- Add support for Python 3.6.

- Drop support for Python 3.3.

- Fix handling of unicode supplemental traceback information on
  Python 2. Now such values are always encoded to UTF-8; previously
  the results were undefined and depended on system encodings and the
  values themselves. See `issue 1 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.exceptions/issues/1>`_.

4.1.0 (2017-04-12)
==================

- Drop support for Python 2.6 and 3.2.

- Make ``exceptionformatter.extract_stack`` signature comply with
  ``traceback.extract_stack``

- Add support for Python 3.5.

4.0.8 (2015-08-13)
==================

- Fixes around ``TextExceptionFormatter`` ``limit``: ``formatException``
  and ``extractStack`` was cutting the traceback at the bottom,
  at the most interesting point. Now it will cut from the middle.
  Some text about the missing entries will be inserted.

- Maybe fix for ``extractStack``, it did not detect recursions in the frames.

4.0.7 (2014-03-19)
==================

- Added explicit support for Python 3.4.

- Updated ``boostrap.py`` to version 2.2.


4.0.6 (2013-02-28)
==================

- Make sure that ``setup.py`` finds all tests. Now tox runs them all as well.

- Fix failing test under Python 3.

- Made buildout work under Python 3 and Buildout 2.


4.0.5 (2012-12-31)
==================

- Fleshed out PyPI Trove classifiers.

- Fixed a test failure under Python 2.6.


4.0.4 (2012-12-13)
==================

- Release with a fixed MANIFEST.in (without ``docs/``)


4.0.3 (2012-12-10)
==================

- Fixed format_exception(..., as_html=True) not to HTML-escape the '<br />'
  it adds to the exception value.


4.0.2 (2012-11-21)
==================

- Test Python 3.3 support under tox.


4.0.1 (2012-08-20)
==================

- Fixed optional dependency code for `'zope.security`` to work under Python 3.3.


4.0.0.1 (2012-05-16)
====================

- Fixed rendering of package docs on PyPI.


4.0.0 (2012-05-16)
==================

- Automated build of Sphinx HTML docs and running doctest snippets via tox.

- Added Sphinx documentation.

- Added support for continuous integration using ``tox`` and ``jenkins``.

- Removed use of '2to3' and associated fixers when installing under Py3k.
  The code is now in a "compatible subset" which supports Python 2.6, 2.7,
  and 3.2, including PyPy 1.8 (the version compatible with the 2.7 language
  spec).

- 100% unit test coverage.

- Dropped explicit support for Python 2.4 / 2.5 / 3.1.

- Added 'setup.py dev' alias (runs ``setup.py develop`` plus installs
  ``nose`` and ``coverage``).

- Added 'setup.py docs' alias (installs ``Sphinx`` and dependencies).


3.7.1 (2012-03-28)
==================

- Fix: missed to reverse extractStack entries


3.7.0 (2012-03-28)
==================

- Added TextExceptionFormatter.extractStack and extract_stack


3.6.2 (2012-03-28)
==================

- Fallback to traceback.format_tb when the formatter is called recursively.
  i.e. Don't let errors in the formatter pass silently.

- Fix deprecated unittest functions: ``assert_`` and ``assertEquals``.

3.6.1 (2010-07-06)
==================

- Fixed tests to work under Python 2.7.

- PEP8 cleanup and removed obsolete build infrastructure files.


3.6.0 (2010-05-02)
==================

- Added support to bootstrap on Jython.

- Added Python 3 support.

- The dependency on zope.testing seemed spurious, possibly a rest of a real
  dependency that is gone now. I removed it.


3.5.2 (2008-04-30)
==================

- Updated CHANGES.txt.


3.5.1 (2008-04-28)
==================

- Reverted changes in 3.5.0.


3.5.0
=====

- Added the capability for exceptions to be formatted line-by-line.
  Unfortunately, also introduced a bug cause each line of the exception to be
  its own log message.


3.4.0 (2007-10-02)
==================

- Updated package meta-data.


3.4.0b2 (2007-08-14)
====================

- Removed superfluous dependency on ``zope.deprecation``.


3.4.0b1 (2007-07-09)
====================

- Corresponds to the version of the ``zope.exceptions`` package shipped as
  part of the Zope 3.4.0b1 release.


3.2.0 (2006-01-05)
==================

- Corresponds to the version of the ``zope.exceptions`` package shipped as part of
  the Zope 3.2.0 release.

- Deprecated the ``INotFoundError`` interface and the corresponding
  ``NotFoundError`` exception class, in favor of "standard" exceptions
  ``AttributeError``, ``KeyError``).  The deprecated items will be removed in
  Zope 3.3.


3.0.0 (2004-11-07)
==================

- Corresponds to the version of the zope.exceptions package shipped as part of
  the Zope X3.0.0 release.
