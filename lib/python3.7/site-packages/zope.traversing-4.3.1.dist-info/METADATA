This package provides adapters for resolving object paths by traversing
an object hierarchy.  This package also includes support for traversal
namespaces (e.g. ``++view++``, ``++skin++``, etc.) as well as computing
URLs via the ``@@absolute_url`` view.

=========
 Changes
=========

4.3.1 (2018-10-16)
==================

- Fix DeprecationWarnings for ``ComponentLookupError`` by
  importing them from ``zope.interface.interfaces``. See `issue 10
  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.traversing/issues/10>`_.


4.3 (2018-10-05)
================

- Add support for Python 3.7.

- Host documentation at https://zopetraversing.readthedocs.io

4.2.0 (2017-09-23)
==================

- Add support for Python 3.6.

- Drop support for Python 3.3.

- Drop support for ``python setup.py test``.

4.1.0 (2016-08-05)
==================

- Add support for Python 3.5.

- Drop support for Python 2.6.

- Gracefully handle ``UnicodeEncodeError`` that can be produced when
  doing attribute lookup on Python 2 by instead raising a ``LocationError``.

4.0.0 (2014-03-21)
==================

- Add support for Python 3.4.


4.0.0a3 (2013-03-12)
====================

- Add support for PyPy.


4.0.0a2 (2013-02-21)
====================

- Remove ``zope.container`` testing dependency to break another circular
  dependency.

- Remove ``zope.pagetemplate`` testing dependency to break another circular
  dependency.

- Remove ``zope.browserpage`` (ZCML) dependency by using low-level directives.

- Remove ``zope.site`` testing dependency.


4.0.0a1 (2013-02-20)
====================

- Replace deprecated ``zope.component.adapts`` usage with equivalent
  ``zope.component.adapter`` decorator.

- Replace deprecated ``zope.interface.implements`` usage with equivalent
  ``zope.interface.implementer`` decorator.

- Drop support for Python 2.4 and 2.5.

- Add support for Python 3.3.

- Fix dependencies : removed ``zope.tal`` and added ``zope.browserpage``.


3.14.0 (2011-03-02)
===================

- Re-release of 3.13.1 as a feature version as it introduces dependencies on
  new feature releases.

3.13.1 (2010-12-14)
===================

- Fix ZCML-related dependencies.

3.13 (2010-07-09)
=================

- When a ``__parent__`` attribute is available on an object, it is
  always used for absolute URL construction, and no ILocation adapter
  lookup is performed for it. This was the previous behavior but was
  broken (around 3.5?) due to dependency refactoring.

  If the object provides no ``__parent__`` then an ILocation adapter
  lookup will be performed. This will always succeed as zope.location
  provides a default LocationProxy for everything, but more specific
  ILocation adapters can also be provided.

3.12.1 (2010-04-30)
===================

- Remove use of ``zope.testing.doctestunit`` in favor of stdlib's doctest.

3.12.0 (2009-12-29)
===================

- Avoid testing dependencies on ``zope.securitypolicies`` and
  ``zope.principalregistry``.

3.11.0 (2009-12-27)
===================

- Remove testing dependency on ``zope.app.publication``.

3.10.0 (2009-12-16)
===================

- Remove stray test claiming a no longer existing dependency on
  ``zope.app.applicationcontrol``.

- Refactor functional tests to loose dependency on both
  ``zope.app.appsetup`` and ``zope.app.testing``.

- Simplify tests for the ``browser`` sub-package by using ``PlacelessSetup``
  from ``zope.component.testing`` instead of ``zope.app.testing``.

- Simplify ``test_dependencies`` module by using ``zope.configuration``
  instead of ``zope.app.testing.functional``.

- Remove testing dependency on ``zope.app.publisher``.

- Replace testing dependency on ``zope.app.security`` with
  ``zope.securitypolicy``.

- Remove testing dependency on ``zope.app.zcmlfiles`` in favor of more
  explicit dependencies.

- Remove testing dependency on ``zope.app.component``.

- Replace a test dependency on ``zope.app.zptpage`` with a dependency on
  ``zope.pagetemplate``.

3.9.0 (2009-12-15)
==================

- Move ``IBeforeTraverseEvent`` here from ``zope.app.publication``,
  as we already deal with publication traversal.

3.8.0 (2009-09-29)
==================

- In ``zope.traversing.api.getParent()``, try to delegate to
  ``zope.location.interfaces.ILocationInfo.getParent()``, analogous to
  ``getParents()``. Keep returning the traversal parent as a fallback.

- Bring ``ITraverser`` back from ``zope.location`` where it had been moved
  to invert the package interdependency, but where it is now no longer used.

3.7.2 (2009-08-29)
==================

- Make virtual hosting tests compatible with ``zope.publisher`` 3.9.
  Redirecting to a different host requires an explicit ``trusted``
  redirect now.

3.7.1 (2009-06-16)
==================

- ``AbsoluteURL`` now implements the fact that ``__call__`` returns the same
  as ``__str__`` in a manner that it applies for subclasses, too, so they only
  have to override ``__str__`` and not both.

3.7.0 (2009-05-23)
==================

- Move the ``publicationtraverse`` module to ``zope.traversing``, removing the
  ``zope.app.publisher`` -> ``zope.app.publication`` dependency (which was a
  cycle).

- Look up the application controller through a utility registration
  rather than a direct reference.

3.6.0 (2009-04-06)
==================

- Change ``configure.zcml`` not to depend on ``zope.app.component``.

- This release includes the BBB-incompatible ``zope.publisher.skinnable``
  change from 3.5.3.

3.5.4 (2009-04-06)
==================

- Revert BBB-incompatible use of ``zope.publisher.skinnable``:  that
  change belongs in a 3.6.0 release, because it requires a BBB-incompatible
  version of ``zope.publisher``.

3.5.3 (2009-03-10)
==================

- Use applySkin from new location. zope.publisher.skinnable instead of
  zope.publisher.browser.

- Use IAbsoluteURL lookup instead of the "absolute_url" view in the
  recursive AbsoluteURL adapters (LP: #338101).

3.5.2 (2009-02-04)
==================

- ``RootPhysicallyLocatable`` is not the same as
  ``LocationPhysicallyLocatable`` (now in ``zope.location``).
  Fix the import and testing setups.

3.5.1 (2009-02-02)
==================

- Obsolete the ``RootPhysicallyLocatable`` adapter, which has been superseded
  by the refactored ``zope.location.traversing.LocationPhysicallyLocatable``
  that we depend on since 3.5.0a4.

  Remove the adapter and its registration, and making its import place
  pointing to ``zope.location.traversing.LocationPhysicallyLocatable``
  to maintain backward-compatibility.

  This also fixes a bug introduced in version 3.5.0a4 when trying to
  call ``getParents`` function for the root object.

- Use direct imports instead of compatibility ones for things that were
  moved to ``zope.location``.

- Remove the ``zope.traversing.interfaces.INamespaceHandler`` interface,
  as it seems not to be used for years.

- Change package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org instead
  of retired zope3-dev at zope.org

3.5.0 (2009-01-31)
==================

- Use zope.container instead of ``zope.app.container``.

- Use zope.site instead of ``zope.app.folder`` in the unit tests.

- Reduce, but not eliminate, test dependencies on ``zope.app.component``.

3.5.0a4 (2008-08-01)
====================

- Reverse dependencies between ``zope.location`` and ``zope.traversing``.

- Update (test) dependencies and tests to expect and work with a spec
  compliant TAL interpreter as available in ``zope.tal`` >= 3.5.0.

- Fix deprecation warning caused by using an old module name for
  ``ZopeSecurityPolicy`` in ``ftesting.zcml``.

- Ensure traversing doesn't raise an TypeError but a TraversalError when the
  traversal step before yielded a string.


3.5.0a3 (2007-12-28)
====================

- Back out the controversial ``++skin++`` traverser for XML-RPC.


3.5.0a2 (2007-11-28)
====================

- Port 3.4.1a1 to trunk

  - Do not use unicode strings to set the application server in the virtual
    host namespace. This caused ``absolute_url`` to create unicode URL's.

- Add a traverer for ``++skin++`` for XMLRPC skins (``IXMLRPCSkinType``).
  This also means that the normal ``++skin++`` namespace handler is only
  bound to ``IBrowserRequest``.

- Resolve the dependency on ``zope.app.applicationcontrol`` by importing the
  application controller only if the package is available.


3.4.1 (2008-07-30)
==================

- Fix deprecation warning caused by using an old module name for
  ``ZopeSecurityPolicy`` in ``ftesting.zcml``.


3.4.1a1 (2007-11-13)
====================

- Do not use unicode strings to set the application server in the virtual
  host namespace. This caused absolute_url to create unicode URL's.


3.4.0 (2007-09-29)
==================

No further changes since 3.4.0a1.

3.4.0a1 (2007-04-22)
====================

Initial release as a separate project, corresponds to ``zope.traversing``
from Zope 3.4.0a1
